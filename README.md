Melting Snowman Word Guessing Game
This project is a basic implementation of a guessing game made entirely using HTML, CSS and JaaScript. You get a random word's blanks on screen and 5 changes to correctly guess it from the alphabet tabs provided on screen. If you guess wrong, chances get decremented by 1 and the snowman image starts melting. Guess it correctly to keep the snowman intact.
